Nonetheless, as you can see, we take your privacy and the protection of your personal information very seriously and strive to meet applicable international standards, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) for European residents, the United Kingdom’s version of GDPR (“UK-GDPR”) and US privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”).</p>

                <h3 class="barTH20 brS03">B. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION/DATA WE COLLECT, HOW WE USE IT AND TO WHOM WE PROVIDE IT</h3>
                <p>We collect various types of personal information from the sources indicated below with respect to your interaction with Sites and our Products (which may include Products of our affiliates, BOSS, Drum Workshop and v-moda) and related offerings. Most of the personal information we collect from you is obtained in the following ways: (1) personal information that you provide to us during registration for certain areas of the Sites, or in connection with your subsequent activities related to the Sites, such as when you choose to subscribe to newsletters or magazines, purchase products or parts, seek customer support or enter contests; (2) personal information we get from certain services such as Google Analytics and for Google Analytics Advertiser Features/Display Advertising to enhance the Sites experience and possibly for promotional purposes. More specifically, we collect the following personal information from the sources listed below for the purposes stated, and disclose it to the third parties listed below:</p>
                <ol class="active">
                    <li>Blog and Community Newsletter; Trade Shows. If you choose to subscribe to our Blog or to our Community Newsletter, we merely ask for your email address, which sends notifications of new Blog posts, and the Newsletter, to you by email. In addition, you may choose to provide us with certain personal information at a trade show or event such as name, email and telephone number, which we may digitize. The personal information described above is stored on WordPress, Shopify, and/or CRM servers which manage this content, and which send email notifications and communications to you. The basis for collection of any personal information for marketing or promotional use would be your opt-in consent if you are resident in the European Economic Area.</li>
                    <li>Community Forums. On the Community pages of the Sites, you may choose to participate in message boards or forums, you may post questions to the Community directly and choose to include some personal information that identifies you, or someone may provide personal information in responding. We do not moderate the message board posts, and merely provide this as a user-friendly service to you; it is operated by Zendesk, our support system provider which may make limited promotional use of personal information that you provide. If we choose to require a login for access, then such personal login information would be disclosed to Zendesk, which powers the Community webpages.</li>
                    <li>User Account; Product Registration. If you choose to create an account on the Sites via Backstage, our customer/support portal for users of Roland, BOSS and Drum Workshop Products we collect your first and last name and email address, so that you can create an encrypted password-controlled account on our system. This enables you to register a Product and it also facilitates our providing you with customer and Product support as well as information about Roland, BOSS and Drum Workshop Products you may own or are thinking about purchasing. Once you are registered, we may collect additional personal information to facilitate certain activities that you choose, as follows: your rebate redemption (requires your shipping address for rebate check); repair/order status (your phone number for issuing RA/repair authorization and support ticketing); contest entry forms and surveys (additional personal information including age and gender). In addition, if you establish an account with Roland via SSO (single sign-on) for Roland, BOSS or Drum Workshop Products, which only requires your email address, the same account can be used to log into various applications, services or websites as you choose.  We generally have a contractual basis (especially if you have purchased and need support for existing products) and/or legitimate interests basis for collecting this personal data. A contest or survey could be a promotional use requiring opt-in. This information is not disclosed to any third parties.</li>
                    <li>Online Store Purchases. In order to complete a purchase via one of the Sites, you may, depending on the Site, need to login to an account in order to be able to proceed to checkout, and you would need to provide at least your email address to access the account. Other purchase information you may be asked to provide, such as credit card information is not collected by or accessible to Roland; provided, however, that we may collect and store your shipping information as necessary to fulfill your order. We do not collect or hold credit card information, which you provide to a secure payment processor via our third-party services providers, such as Shopify. We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties, and encourage you to review their privacy policies before supplying them with information.</li>
                    <li>GPS Data.We may use geo-location/GPS information for identifying out-of-country visitors (via IP address detection), which is generally used to route you to the appropriate Roland national or language website, and to facilitate your use of our Dealer Locator and Service Center Locator pages, but we do not store this information and it is not required from you. Moreover, often it consists of nothing more than your zip code or your location, and we cannot identify you from such information. To the extent such GPS or zip code information alone could be considered personal information, there is a legitimate interest in routing you to the appropriate country-specific Roland website in response to your request for the appropriate dealer or service center, and Roland complies with all privacy requirements applicable in such country (e.g., all GDPR requirements if the country indicated by its flag icon is in the European Union), as well as in fulfilling your request to find a Dealer or Service Center near you.</li>
                    <li>Content Management and Metrics. Certain content management and measurement software/services that we use, such as Kentico, Adobe Analytics, AudienceX, Active Campaign, Storyblok, Shopify, Quivers, Hubspot, ZenDesk, and various Google services aimed at usage monitoring and tracking, advertising and retargeting activities, collect device identifiers (such as IP address), date and time of Site access by users and mobile network information including phone number, which enables us to gather aggregate, anonymized and/or de-identified demographic information about our users, and in certain cases to provide us with more detailed demographics about Site users. We also use this information to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in various areas of our Sites and to ensure a better user experien to be able to proceed to checkout, and you would need to provide at least your email address to access the account. Other purchase information you may be asked to provide, such as credit card information is not collected by or accessible to Roland; provided, however, that we may collect and store your shipping information as necessary to fulfill your order. We do not collect or hold credit card information, which you provide to a secure payment processor via our third-party services providers, such as Shopify. We are not responsible for the practices of such third parties, and encourage you to review their privacy policies before supplying them with information.</li>
                    <li>Tracking. Some of the tracking and retargeting described in the prior paragraph is used by our Site content management software to make you aware of products, promotions and issues that may be of interest to you. Services such as Podium, AudienceX and Google Analytics Advertiser Features/Display Advertising may be used to communicate with and/or to serve tailored ads to users, and enable features such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We may have a legitimate interest in why we provide this information to you, as it may relate to purchases you have made, otherwise this may be a promotional use and may require your opt-in consent, depending on applicable law in your location.</li>
                    <li>Underage Users. We and the Site focus upon the sale of musical and audio products, and we are not aimed at, nor do we knowingly collect, personal information from users under the age of 16. While consumers under 16 must opt-in to any sale or sharing of their personal information under the CCPA, we do not sell or disclose personal information.</li>
                    <li>Minors under 18 years of age may have the personal information that they have provide to Roland through the Site deleted by sending an email to privacy@rolandus.com requesting deletion.  Please note that, while we make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all systems.</li>

                <p>SUPPLEMENTAL PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND CERTAIN OTHER US STATES (as applicable).</p>
                <p>“State Privacy Laws” means all U.S. privacy and data protection laws and regulations applicable to Roland’s processing of customer personal information in the provision of services to the customer, including, as applicable, (a) the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq., as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and its implementing regulations (“CCPA”); (b) Colorado Privacy Act, Colorado Rev. Stat. §§ 6-1-1301 to 6-1-1313 (“ColoPA”); (c) Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act, Public Act No. 22-15) (“CPOMA”); ; (d) Utah Consumer Privacy Act (Utah Code Ann. §§ 13-61-101 to 13-61-404) (“UCPA”); and (e) Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, Virginia Code Ann. §§ 59.1-575 to 59.1-585 (“VCDPA”). California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia and Utah shall be referred to collectively as the “States.”</p>
                <p>Please bear in mind that the State Privacy Laws of individual states may not apply to Roland and consequently may not give you certain rights even if you are a resident of a state listed above, because generally such laws apply only to businesses that meet certain thresholds based on the amount of processing of personal information of consumers resident in such state during a calendar year.  In a growing number of states, the relevant threshold is generally that Roland has processed the personal information of 100,000 consumers in such state in a calendar year, which Roland may not meet.  Nonetheless, Roland strives to apply high privacy standards, and so on a case-by-case basis may comply with consumer requests related to the privacy standards set forth below even if a given consumer has no legal right to make such request.</p>
                <div>
                    <span>Your State Privacy Rights. If you are a resident of one of the States, State Privacy Laws may provide you with the following rights with respect to your personal information:</span>
                    <ol class="active">
                        <li>The right to know what personal information we have collected, used or disclosed about you.</li>
                        <li>The right to request that we delete any personal information we have collected about you.</li>
                        <li>The right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information we have collected about you.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>Submitting Requests. You may submit requests to delete, correct and/or to know personal information we have collected about you by contacting us at privacy@rolandus.com or by contacting our toll-free telephone number at 1-877-339-5494 ext. 3900.</p>
                <p>We will respond to your request in compliance with the requirements of the State Privacy Law or other applicable law.</p>
                <p>Verification of Your Identity.  When you exercise these rights and submit a request to us, we or our partners will verify your identity by asking you to authenticate your identity via standard authentication procedures. For example, we may ask for your email address, order numbers of previous orders of our products and services, or the date of your last purchase from us. We also may use a third-party verification provider to verify your identity.</p>
                <p>Authorized Agents. You may permit an authorized agent to submit a request to know, delete or correct your personal information. If we receive a request on your behalf, we will ask that person to give us proof that you gave that person written permission to make a request for you. If that person does not provide us with written proof, we will deny their request so that we can protect your personal information.</p>
                <div>
                    <span>California Business Contact Information. If you are a California resident and we receive your personal information in the form of contact details from business events, for example as part of a business appointment (e.g., by exchanging business cards) or as part of any other form of collaboration, we may use your contact and business details to maintain our business contacts. For this purpose, we may transfer your contact details to our internal database.  Pursuant to the CCPA, you have the privacy rights under State Privacy Laws with respect to your business contact personal information described above. The processing activity may include the following data categories:</span>
                    <ol class="active">
                        <li>Your contact information (e.g., name, title, form of address or salutation, address, gender, telephone numbers, email address); and</li>
                        <li>The right to know what personal information we have collected, used or disclosed about you.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>This data processing is based on our legitimate business interests. We have a legitimate economic interest in maintaining contacts beyond the initial context and in using them to establish and develop a business relationship and to remain in contact with the parties concerned.</p>
                <p>Such business contacts could also be easily processed in our email communications with you and then kept in typical business software, either centrally or on the electronic devices of our employees.</p>
                <p>No Sale of Personal Information. Roland DOES NOT SELL your personal information, as that term is defined under the CCPA.</p>
                <p>Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising. We will not share your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising, as those terms are defined under the CCPA.</p>
                <p>Non-Discrimination. If you make a request under a State Privacy Law, we will not discriminate against you in any way. For example, we will not deny you goods or services, charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, deny you discounts or other benefits or impose penalties on you, or provide you with or suggest that you will receive a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>
                <p>Retention. We may retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with legal or regulatory requirements. We strive to retain your personal information no longer than is reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy or as required by law.  We retain your personal information following the end of your services or other business relationship in accordance with applicable law and our data retention and destruction policies.</p>
                <p>Sensitive Personal Information. We may collect some sensitive personal information, as that term is defined under State Privacy Laws and as described in this Privacy Policy, such as your credit card payment information or precise geolocation data. Your sensitive personal information will not be used for any additional purposes that are incompatible with the purposes listed above, unless we provide you with notice of those additional purposes.</p>
                <p>Automated Decision-Making. We generally do not use automated decision-making technology, as that term is defined by the U.S. Privacy Laws. If we make use of automated decision-making technology, you will be informed through a separate privacy notice.</p>
