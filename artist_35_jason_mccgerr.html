            <p class="barRO24">Jason has worked steadily for the past years as a performer and educator both regionally and across the US. He is a member of the internationally known band Death Cab For Cutie. He has also been very involved as a session player, engineer, studio drum tech and side man working with independent and major label artist that are nationally recognized in various genres of music. In addition to his busy schedule as a player, Jason has been a core staff member and private instructor at The Seattle Drum School of Music for the past years. He holds a steady cliental of forty to fifty students each week ranging in ages 4 to 60 years old, beginners to advanced players, including local and touring professionals. His expertise has been requested for clinics at schools and local music stores and to be one of the recognized judges for the annual Guitar Center Drum Off Regional Finals. Jason's primary music education can be attributed to becoming a student at The Seattle Drum School in 1992 where he studied with owner Steve Smith. "Steve taught me a great deal about his many systems of independence. He also taught me how to teach myselfвЂ¦.. And now I teach at his school because I believe in his curriculum". But before returning as a teacher he sought out further instruction in the area of technique from John Fisher, a North American Solo Drum Champion, and internationally honored clinician and performer from Vancouver, B.C. John was a member of the Shotts and Dykehead Scottish Pipe band lead by Alex Duthert through several World Championships. Jason studied with John consistently for 3 years and still visits him on occasion. "John Fisher showed me how to economize my stick motions and really dig deep into what's going on with the hands." Another teacher who has made a great impression on his playing style is Jim Kilpatrick from Glasgow, Scotland. He is the current World Solo Drumming Champion, holds 13 individual titles and 12 band titles as leader of the Shotts & Dykehead Pipe Band, 11 of which are consecutive. Jason attended one his many distinguished schools that he teaches abroad and enjoyed some very thorough private and group instruction in Scottish Drumming. Jason appeared also on the Modern Drummer Drum Festival and at PASIC 2010 in Indianapolis.</p>
