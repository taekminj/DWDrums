                <h3 class="barTH20 brS03">Ordering Information:</h3>
                <p>We use Shopify for accepting and fulfilling orders on the Website. In order to complete a purchase you will be sent to the Shopify platform. We do not accept COD orders, or telephone, postal mail, email or Fax email orders. If you do not register an account with DW, Shopify does not share your information with us except as necessary to facilitate shipping of your order. DW is not responsible for Shopify’s procedures and practices, and accordingly we encourage you to review their terms and conditions and privacy policy.</p>
                <p>Tax will be applied to your order if it is delivered from the same state or province as your shipping address. Some areas require tax to be assessed on shipping and handling charges. We don't know the fulfillment location until after you place your order, so your checkout screen and order confirmation email may not include taxes. When you check out, you can view the shipping and handling charges for your order. In the rare case that shipping and handling charges exceed the amount shown, we will notify you. Your state or province may require tax to be applied to shipping and handling charges.</p>
                <p>DW only ships within the United States of America, excluding the regions: Alaska, Armed Forces Africa, Armed Forces Americas, Armed Forces Canada, Armed Forces Europe, Armed Forces Middle East, Armed Forces Pacific, Guam, Hawaii, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</p>
                <p>DW Standard: purchases of $0.01 to $99.99 (includes taxes) = $9.99 shipping fee; $100-$249.99 = $19.99 shipping fee; Over $250 = $29.99. The foregoing rates may not apply to promotional offers. In all events, and notwithstanding any conflict with the foregoing, DW reserves the right in its sole absolute discretion to determine shipping charges. Tax and duty fees may be charged by your country when your order arrives. Those additional charges are your responsibility.</p>

                <h3 class="barTH20 brS03">Return Policy:</h3>
                <p>To return a product, contact info@DWDrums.com to initiate a return and we will email you instructions for returning your product. Please ship your unused product, in its original packaging, to the address identified in our email. Original delivery fees are refunded only if returns are for defective products, products damaged during shipping, or incorrect orders. You are responsible for shipping the products back to us. We recommend using a trackable shipping method. We are not responsible and will not issue refunds for items lost in shipping. Individual products may be excluded from this return policy. Please check the product description before you place your order.</p>
                <p>If the return is due to defective products, damage caused during shipping, or an incorrect order, contact info@DWDrums.com to initiate the return. In these cases, you may be compensated for the return shipping. If an order arrives to you with obvious shipping damage, please refuse the delivery. If you have accepted delivery and then find shipping damage, please call the fulfiller immediately using the contact information included with the order. Please save all packaging material and paperwork for the order if shipping damage is a possible issue. If you dispose of packaging material or attempt to return the merchandise without contacting the fulfiller, you jeopardize our chances of making a claim, and you may not receive credit for the return.</p>
                <p>The billing address you provide must match the billing address that is on file with the financial institution that issued the payment card. If a payment card authorization fails, we reserve the right to cancel your order without notifying you. Service Provider cannot resolve payment card problems with your credit card company or financial institution if a payment card is declined. It is your responsibility, as a consumer, to settle such problems with the issuing institution.</p>
                <p>We accept no responsibility for user-initiated damage and/or loss of parts incurred during operation or use of product.</p>
